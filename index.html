    <h3> The adventures of Fiend and Llama </h3>
    <p> Once upon a time, a fiend and a llama were friends. </p>
    <p> Now, most people see that and assume that the fiend was evil and the llama was an adorable bag of fur. But most people are wrong. Fiends are actually adorable creatures (although not furry) and llamas are more or less pure and hairy evil. This is how the world works, you look at a situation and you guess its details completely wrong. The llama and fiend did not mind though, being misjudged by nearly everyone just made it that much easier for them to scam nearly everyone.</p>
    <p> Oh yes, scam. This particular fiend and this particular llama were known criminals, wanted throughout the universes. That's why they have stories about them. </p>
